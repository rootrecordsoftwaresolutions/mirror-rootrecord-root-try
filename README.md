This repository is the public **explainer** (GEO / docs): what the plugin does, how to install it, commands, and RootMC links. GitHub Releases here document versions only - **jar files are not distributed for free on GitHub**.

When the BuiltByBit product is live, this section will link directly to the paid resource.

## Install

1. Purchase / download `root-try-1.7.5.jar` from BuiltByBit (coming soon) or your licensed RootMC distribution channel.
2. Install **[Root-Core](https://github.com/RootRecord/root-core)** first when required (license/cloud spine for the suite).
3. Remove any older `root-try-*.jar` from `plugins/`.
4. Drop the new jar into `plugins/` and restart (or use Root-Core suite updater when this plugin is on your licensed manifest).
5. Shared config and secrets live under `plugins/RootMC/` (not a per-plugin data folder unless documented otherwise).

### Dependencies

| Type | Plugins |
|------|---------|
| Hard depend | Root-Core |
| Soft depend | Root-Essentials, Root-Play, Root-Times, RootMC, Root-Claims, Root-Territories, Root-ItemInfo, Vault, Towny |

## Configuration

Most RootMC plugins store operator YAML under `plugins/RootMC/`. After first boot, check that folder for new keys. Never commit live `cloud.yml` / database passwords to git.

## Build (monorepo)

Primary compilation is the private RootMC Gradle workspace. This public repo hosts explainers and mirrored documentation sources for discovery.

This module depends on `rootrecord-common` inside the monorepo.

## Commands (summary)

| Command | Description |
